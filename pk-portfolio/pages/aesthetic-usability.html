               <p class="article-callout">Functionality is one of the largest pillars of good UX Design. But how far can aesthetics go to save a product suffering from major functional flaws? Prime Digital Academy needed a new gift to provide to their students. I researched what it means to be a Prime student and what students find meaningful.</p>
               <br/>
               <h4>How un-usable?</h4>
               <p>What does it take to create a meaningful interaction? Many of the objects we use day to day were created to maximize functionality and simplify the life of the user. And yet there are many examples of poorly functioning applications and products that are top seller In their segment. Tesla recently shifted the perspective of the standardized format for a car interior, specifically the dash. The form over function approach takes the idea of aesthetic-usability to its limit. Many of the options for simple tasks that are given their own button on a standard dashboard are buried behind a series of menus in the Tesla. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/tesla-model-3-review/">Reviewers and owners</a> are heralding the spartan interior as game-changing. A more difficult functionality is forgiven due to it’s aesthetically pleasing nature. I saw a similar experience in my project with Prime Digital Academy’s welcome gift.</p>
               <h4>Primed for Success</h4>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c img-shrink">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="student"><label for="student" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/aesthetics/student.jpg" alt="image of young student"></label>
                 <label for="student" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/aesthetics/student.jpg" alt="image of young student"></label>

               <!--<img style="padding-top: 0;" src="../img/qlick-flights/student.jpg" />-->
               <p>Prime Digital Academy needed to find a new gift to provide to full stack development students. The gift would be provided to each individual joining the program. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Heuristic analysis</a> revealed that the previous gift, a water bottle, did not fit the lifestyle of the students. Issues ranged from an insecure lid to a fragile glass body. The bottle had to go.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c img-shrink">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="bottle"><label for="bottle" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/aesthetics/bottle.jpg" alt="Old Prime water bottle"></label>
                 <label for="bottle" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/aesthetics/bottle.jpg" alt="Old Prime water bottle"></label>
               </div>
               <p>While studying at Prime, students received training on how to maximize their career network. Networking was just as integral to their success as their education. Getting to their end goal requires more than just coding. It became clear that providing students with a tool that enhances their networking capabilities would help elevate their chances of landing their dream job. It would also help Prime achieve it’s goal of getting Prime professionals into workplaces around the Twin Cities.</p>
               <h4>Networking Necessities</h4>
               <p>Networking events are the center of career opportunity. I began to explore the possibility of using business cards as a tool for Prime students to enhance the way they network. I created a design concept for a business card holder that would be provided to each student along with a set of personalized business cards. Using this design concept, I created a low fidelity prototype to test with real Prime students.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c img-shrink">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="card-holder"><label for="card-holder" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/aesthetics/card-holder.jpeg" alt="Business card holder"></label>
                 <label for="card-holder" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/aesthetics/card-holder.jpeg" alt="Business card holder"></label>
               </div>
               <p class="img-cap jc-c as-c">Low fidelity prototype made from wood at Leonardo's Basement.</p>
               <p>I interviewed current students using questions derived from the <a href="https://www.usabilitybok.org/critical-incident-technique">Critical Incident technique</a>. I hoped to identify the importance of business cards and the impact a premium quality card holder would have on their networking techniques. The feedback we got was incredible. Students immediately attached to the aesthetics of the case. However, they could not find any use for the business cards.  One student stated “I mean, I like that its wood but it has no practical value… Who uses business cards anymore?” Our business card holder, was an outdated idea. However, we caught a glimpse of an opportunity for a much more meaningful connection with the students.</p>
               <h4>Powerful Perspective</h4>
               <p>Despite these comments students still found the initial prototype attractive. When interviewing them on the card holder’s effectiveness they were almost rooting for it to be more functional than it was. Each subject reported a desire for the aesthetic piece but couldn’t see a use for business cards. I knew I was on to something. Instead of trying to add another tool to their repertoire I decided to adapt the items I was trying to protect.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>All students used their phones, specifically the LinkedIn app, as their main tool for maintaining network contacts. These future innovators were shedding a standard business practice of business cards for a far more cost-effective alternative. I decided to pivot the design concept to a phone case that would be personalized with the Prime logo. It would protect the tool they are already using for networking. The phone case could also spark up a conversation with someone who appreciated the aesthetic quality or recognized the Prime logo. I researched potential offerings and found Woodchuck USA. Woodchuck USA is a Minnesota based company that sells premium quality wood products such as laptop skins, phone cases, and journals. </p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c img-shrink">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="phone"><label for="phone" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/aesthetics/phone.png" alt="Phone case with Prime logo engraved"></label>
                 <label for="phone" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/aesthetics/phone.png" alt="Phone case with Prime logo engraved"></label>
               </div>
               <p class="img-cap jc-c as-c">Phone case with Prime logo engraved.</p>
               <p>To determine if these cases would be a good fit for Prime students I proposed a second round of research. Would students carry over their same affinity for the aesthetics of the case? Would they find it more useful? Conducting a desirability analysis would show if students found the same themes in the new gift.</p>
               <h4>Providing a meaningful Gift</h4>
               <p>At the onset of this project, Prime aimed to provide their students with a meaningful gift that would symbolize the school’s values and their passion for their students. We found a strong connection with the aesthetic desires of students at Prime. Like Tesla’s stark interior, subjects were willing to overlook certain usability problems because of their affinity for the object. Instead of asking how to manipulate the usability of the product I determined that carrying over the style to a modern alternative would work equally as well. Providing a personalized phone case, Prime would be able to provide a gift that protects each student’s phone. And protecting their phone would help protect their future.</p>
               <br />
               <p>I learned a valuable lesson during this case study, that aesthetics isn’t everything. Even the best looking tool can be useless if its not the right tool for the job. But if you can carry that look and feel over to the best tool, then you can create something great.</p>
