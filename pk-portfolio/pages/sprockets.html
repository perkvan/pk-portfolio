               <p class="article-callout">Creating a meaingingful first impression is important. Users on Sprockets website identified an innate sense of trust for the organization due primarily to its kid-friendly aesthetics. Will that first positive interaction carry over through the users experience on the entire site? I tested that theory, trying to find the limits of aesthetic forgiveness.</p>
               <br/>
               <h4>About Sprockets</h4>
               <p>Sprockets is an out-of-school and after-school advocacy organization. Not only do they advocate but they also help parents and youth find programs to join within the St. Paul area. Using Sprockets, St. Paulites are able to get their kids into sports, educational programs, and more. Their website is a resource for the benefits of quality programming. I worked with a team of three other UXers to improve the experience for users of <a href="https://www.sprocketssaintpaul.org/">www.sprocketsstpaul.org</a>.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>Sprockets outlined a set of primary user goals and site goals they had for their website. Our team ran the site through a heuristics evaluation to determine key problems. We found several elements of interest that were hurting the site's experience.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="search-results"><label for="search-results" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/sprockets/search-results.png" alt="search-results"></label>
                 <label for="search-results" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/sprockets/search-results.png" alt="search-results"></label>
               </div>
               <h4>Sprocket's Program Finder</h4>
               <p>The program finder (pictured above) is the primary tool of the website. It offers a means to find and register for programs in the St. Paul area. Our findings revealed a lack of information hierarchy. Users also had little control when searching for programs for their child. As Sprockets is a non-profit organization, on a non-profit budget, it was important for us to identify the most important problems. We needed a usability test.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="test-room"><label for="test-room" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/sprockets/test-room-1.jpg" alt="test room with participant"></label>
                 <label for="test-room" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/sprockets/test-room-1.jpg" alt="test room with participant"></label>
               </div>
               <p>Each member of our team would conduct two remote usability tests and one in person test. Participants completed a set of scenarios, constructed to direct them to pain-points. We gathered background information to identify our participants familiarity with Sprockets.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>We had a range of participants. Several parents and a couple individuals with extensive extracurricular experience. All users mirrored Sprocket's message of the importance of out-of-school activities. When presented with the home page of Sprockets, all users reported a trust and satisfaction with the site. Users said that the styling fit what they thought a kid-oriented site should look like. Though they trusted the site, each participant did express feeling overwhelmed by the page at first glance. Users then went on to identify navigational issues with the website. They were willing to overlook nuisances because of the sites aesthetics. I wondered if this  forgiveness would carry over to the Program Finder’s search functionality.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="search-field"><label for="search-field" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/sprockets/search-results.png" alt="Search field from Sprockets Program Finder tool"></label>
                 <label for="search-field" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/sprockets/search-results.png" alt="Search field from Sprockets Program Finder tool"></label>
               </div>
               <p class="img-cap jc-c as-c">Program finder tool on Sprockets website.</p>
               <p>We asked participants to locate a program for a child using the site’s Program Finder tool. We provided an age, dates, and an activity type for the users to search for. Participants had several opportunities to find a program that would fit all parameters. Even with providing them specific instructions, three out of twelve participants were unable to find a program. They also reported difficulty finding key information about the program. Others complained about the lack of search parameters. All forgiveness from the websites styling had vanished.</p>
               <h4>A Targeted Solution</h4>
               <p>At this point in our research, our team had ascertained some meaningful insights. We all created individual recommendations on how Sprockets could improve these experiences. I felt that the easiest way to confront these issues was to focus on refining the hierarchy of information. With a couple of lines of CSS and a little more information present search results could offer a great deal more.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="updated-results"><label for="updated-results" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/sprockets/updated-results-page.png" alt="results page prototype"></label>
                 <label for="updated-results" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/sprockets/updated-results-page.png" alt="results page prototype"></label>
               </div>
               <p>Elevating information like the date, time, and putting the quality partner designation on the search results page would help users to better compare programs at a quick glance. I suggested carrying that same information hierarchy over to the individual program pages. Bringing important elements, like the register CTA, helps create a stronger journey. Users won't feel as lost or unguided as they did before.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="program-info"><label for="program-info" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/sprockets/new-program-info.png" alt="program info on sprockets website"></label>
                 <label for="program-info" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/sprockets/new-program-info.png" alt="program info on sprockets website"></label>
               </div>
               <p>I also recommended that Sprockets provide their users with a more powerful search. Users all relayed the importance of finding a program that fits their schedule. Why not provide them with the means to define their schedule from the beginning?</p>
               </br>
               <p>Sprocket’s website seems to have struck a chord with parents. Users trusted the site without much reason beyond it looking like a children's website. It is surprising the powers of aesthetics on an individuals perception of their experience. I had always heralded cleaner, less clutter web sites, as they instilled an inherent trust for me. But now I see how this same effect can apply for other scenarios. And if a style and presentation can evoke those emotions, how much better could a user’s experience be following some basic usability heuristics? With a couple of small changes users should be able to better find programs for their children. Thereby accomplishing Sprocket's goal of getting more kids into quality programming.</p>
