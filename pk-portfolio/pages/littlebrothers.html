               <p class="article-callout">As America’s largest population enters retirement, it is faced with a major issue. An isolated or lonely elder is at increased risk of succumbing to health complications. It is imperative that society help identify these individuals and put into place systems that will maintain these elders’ quality of life. Prime teamed up with Little Brothers: Friends of the Elderly to identify the best way to reach this aging population.</p>
               <br/>
               <h4>An Aging Population</h4>
               <p>But how do you reach a population that is isolated? We met with Little Brothers for an exploratory meeting. Little Brothers outlined their current strategy and process for engaging the elderly. Ninety percent of elders enter the program via referrals.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="group"><label for="group" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/littlebrothers/group.jpg" alt="group shot of individuals doing a user experience deep dive"></label>
                 <label for="group" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/littlebrothers/group.jpg" alt="group shot of individuals doing a user experience deep dive"></label>
               </div>
               <p>The inability to reach the individuals affected proved a great obstacle. But what if we were able to activate the community around the elders? Our team hypothesized that a grassroots campaign involving local professionals and community partners would offer the most opportunity to identify isolated and lonely elders. To reach the elders, we would need to cast a large net of awareness.</p><br />
               <p>We looked to their volunteer network to see if they could help identify at risk elders and found that Little Brothers focuses primarily on visiting volunteers. A visiting volunteer is an individual who goes to an elder’s house for one-on-one personal interaction. Little Brothers asks for a minimum one year commitment of four to six hours per month. It also requires an orientation and training session as well as a background check. These steps ensure that elders are getting the best experience and can feel certain about the individuals coming into their homes.</p><br />
               <h4>Smaller Buy-in</h4>
               <p>A one year commitment to an individual you don’t know is a pretty large buy-in for a volunteer. We asked whether a smaller buy-in up front would lead to more individuals becoming involved. </p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="group-2"><label for="group-2" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/littlebrothers/group-2.jpg" alt="group shot of individuals doing a user experience deep dive"></label>
                 <label for="group-2" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/littlebrothers/group-2.jpg" alt="group shot of individuals doing a user experience deep dive"></label>
               </div>
               <p>During our deep dive, we identified that the holiday dinners sponsored by Little Brothers result in high community engagement but are difficult for Little Brothers to plan and execute. We suggested that these types of events need not be as big or for only special occasions. With numerous smaller events, Little Brothers could expand their network.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="strategy-map"><label for="strategy-map" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/littlebrothers/Strategy-Map.jpg" alt="strategy map for Little littlebrothers"></label>
                 <label for="strategy-map" class="grid-item"><img src="../img/littlebrothers/Strategy-Map.jpg" alt="strategy map for Little littlebrothers"></label>
               </div>
               <p>Our team created a design strategy map with specific touch points to increase awareness and engagement. Pamphlets for neighborhood partners. Email campaigns for corporate sponsors to activate a volunteer base. Handwritten cards for a more meaningful connection. As the net grew, so did the opportunity to reach at risk individuals.</p><br />
               <h4>Battling stigma</h4>
               <p>Unfortunately, there is often a stigma attached to being elderly or lonely. As our net grows, it is imperative that anyone attempting to connect with the elder population approaches the issue with respect. It is important that any approach empower and not belittle elders. We suggested framing messaging around the goal of saving elders’ stories and passing experiences to younger generations. By asking for elders help, the organization would be giving meaning to joining beyond just ending isolation. It would offer a means for elders to feel as though they were giving back to their community.</p><br />
               <p>As a comprehensive effort, our team made a short video of the methods to be applied. The video outlines strategies and the design thinking behind the prototyped touch points. We also created a prototype package that further explained the goals and benefits of each touchpoint See the video below.</p>

               </div>
               <br/>
               <p>In order to implement such a large-scale plan, I created an implementation roadmap for Little Brothers to follow. This roadmap outlines the key strategies and measurable analytics that would help the company determine the efficacy of the strategy.</p>

               <h4>Conclusion</h4>
               <p>It takes a village, is an old phrase often used to describe the necessity of community for rearing a child. But what about when that child reaches old age? Our society has little in place to identify and address elder isolation and loneliness. By raising awareness and activating the community around elders, we are reducing the risk of individuals being forgotten. By providing those elders with a goal to share their stories and experiences, we are improving their quality of life and meaning. By bringing these community members and elders together to share stories, we can begin to minimize the issues of isolation and loneliness.</p>
