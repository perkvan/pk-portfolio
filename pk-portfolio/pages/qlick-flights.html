               <p class="article-callout">Booking a flight is arduous. Finding a flight within your price and date range means navigating multiple sites to see which airline is offering what. The mental gymnastics to calculate the best fit for your itinerary is exhausting. Not to mention, the frustration that can occur when you finally get to the end of the process and realize your price is different than what you were first promised.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>Create a place users want to be, and never give them a reason to leave. A booking experience that minimizes input, presents accurate information and feels personalized will elevate itself in the market. In this busy world, users don't have time to deal with anything less.</p>
               <br />
               <p>That was our main goal with Qlick Flights, ease. Ease of use and ease of mind. An aesthetically simple design reinforcing a sense of usability and trust. Making it the go-to suggestion when people ask “how do you book your flights?”</p>
               <h4>My Role</h4>
                <p>Using directed storytelling we studied the standard process of booking a flight online. During research, our subjects recounted one memorable booking experience. All users expressed dissatisfaction with some part of their booking experiences. Each individual reported untrustworthy pricing, predatory advertisements and promotions, and an overwhelming amount of data entry. With this our goal statement was born.</p>
                <h5 class="as-c">Goal Statement</h5>
                <quote style="padding: 0 2rem 2rem 2rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">My user is a fiscally-responsible person who wants to book flights that have accurate pricing. They want a streamlined experience that allows them to book with minimal input.</quote>
               <h4 style="margin-bottom: -1rem;">Pen to Paper</h4>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">
                 <input type="checkbox" id="qf-1"><label for="qf-1" class="lightbox"><img src="../img/qlick-flights/qf-1.jpg" alt="Qlick Flights search page"></label>

               <!--<img style="padding-top: 0;" src="../img/qlick-flights/qf-1.jpg" />-->
               <p>I began sketching my ideas on paper and came up with the general flow of a first time user booking a flight. This included a home page with flight search fields, a search results page, and an itinerary page. Users were presented with minimal input on the first page. Just enough information to start searching for flights.</p>
               <br />
               <p>Next, the search results page showed the potential flights in ascending order from cheapest to most expensive. Emphasizing the important elements and reducing the required inputs means the user could select their flights, outbound and return, with just one click.</p>
               <div class="flex jc-c as-c ai-c js-c">

               <p>After selecting both flights, the user is presented with an itinerary. Outbound and return flights would be detailed along with the cost break down for each element, as a means to reinforce the user that the price they see is what they get.</p>

               </div>
               <p class="img-cap jc-c as-c">Itinerary page, shows user their selected flights and the price breakdown.</p>
               <p>When booking a flight, its unavoidable to enter the passenger information. Allowing a user to save their information for future bookings reduces the work required for future bookings. Placing this on the Itinerary page, along with the option to checkout as a guest, aims to instill trust with the user that their information is being saved for their benefit.</p>

              <a href="https://qeq9gi.axshare.com/#c=2" class="btn-prime btn-solid--light">Try Prototype</a>
              <p>I used Axure RP to create a prototype to conduct usability-tests with 4 participants. This provided invaluable insight into the way users stated they like to work with a website versus how they actually interacted. The minimal input and rapid booking process was well received by all participants. Although, several users expressed concerns that they weren’t getting all the information.</p>
              <br />
              <p>Sign up engagement proved difficult as users did not want to have to complete a registration. Once the users were prompted to create an account and try booking again, there was an immediate gain perceived. Each individual commented on how their information was stored and they did not have to do as much, creating a more positive user experience. This revealed an opportunity to onboard users with their first flight booking as opposed to having them sign up before booking.</p>
              <br />
              <p>For the full Usability Testing results, <a href="../img/qlick-flights/UsabilityTest-FindingsReport.pdf">see the PDF here</a>.</p>
              <h4>Key Findings</h4>
              <p>In my initial research users reported a disdain for the overwhelming amount of options and screens required to book a single flight. The initial designs and prototypes proved that users appreciated a streamlined process, but questioned lack of choice. A fine balance must be struck between intrusive and inclusive. A user must be able to make all the choices they want, but report a more preferable experience when it is an opt-in instead of an opt-out. The flexibility of certain flight options could be increased in future prototypes to see if users report more confidence in their control. In future iterations it will be important to identify how much decision making can be provided to the customer before the usability suffers.</p>
