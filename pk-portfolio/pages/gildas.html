                   <p class="article-callout">Gilda's Club Twin Cities is an amazing organization that offers support to individuals battling cancer. They also provide support to the friends and family affected by this drastic life change. With hundreds of programs monthly, a plethora of donation campaigns running, and a full time staff of only 5 individuals, the team is spread thin.
                   </p>
                   <br />
                   <p>Gilda's Club gathers data via 7+ different sytems tracking their programs attendance, donations, staff volunteer and more. With all of this data across so many channels its difficult to identify what elements of the organization are working well and what elements are not.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>The organization approaced Prime with the idea of unifying their data into a single platform that could provide meaningful insights. These insights would then be used to orient business goals and practices. Ensuring the organization is utilizing the donations they receive to the best of their ability.</p>

         <h2>Current workflow</h2>
         <div class="flex column as-fs article">
           <p>When we were approched by Ryan Sweeney and the Gilda's Club team, we asked for an overview of the processes in place for tracking data and identifying trends. Ryan outlined the laborious process it took him of downloading data and entering the information into customized excel spreadsheets. He would spend approximately 4 hours weekly working on synthesizing data to provide in a report form to his board of directors and executive team.</p>
           <br />
           <p>While this information was invaluable to the organization, allowing it to make data informed decisions, it created a ton of extra work for Ryan. This work was also not part of his job description but was passed to him as he was the most capable team member. Providing Ryan with an opportunity to synthesize data with less work on his end would allow him to get back to his actual role.</p>

           <br />
           <p>Between interviews with Gilda's Club team members and an analysis of the data they tracked, our team identified key insights that would aid the business in their decision making. We gathered all 7 sources of data and verified the format in which that data would be received. Once we had our key insights we built mockup dashboards representational of the information we thought would best serve our user.</p><br />

           </div>
           <br />
           <p>Building buy-in is easier than selling it. We practiced this strategy by incorporating Ryan in a collaborative design session based on card-sorting and flexible modeling methodologies. He was asked to organize key insights by importance to himself, the board, and his executive team members. After we had established an informational hierarchy, we asked Ryan to organize the data into logical groupings. Providing him with this opportunity allowed him to invest himself in the end product and feel as though his voice was truly heard. After our second round of user input we were ready to design our business intelligence system.</p><br />

             <div style="z-index: 1;" class="column _3x as-c article">
             <p>I began design to address these issues by creating an enhanced dashboard. The main screen provides the user with a quick overview of their status as well as a bit of historical data. Showing the most pertinent elements allows the user to get in, get a strong idea of how they are doing, and get out and on with their life. This minimization of on-screen time was a key factor for Aneela and her team. I carried this mantra through the rest of the suggested feature additions.</p>

               <p>The journal’s data is also used within the recap feature. Recap shows the users trends to motivate and inspire or indicate when a change may need to be made. It shows the past month’s number of tracked events and the most used tags and locations for high frequency engagement in the user’s repetitive behavior. This feature offers a means for goal tracking and to summarize the large data sets that were prevalent in the app previously. Providing this information in a more digestible format helps the user focus on the most important elements. It also helps the user get the most meaningful interaction without a large amount of data analysis.</p>

             <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
             <p>Many apps today identify ways to make our lives easier, more entertaining, and more fulfilling. For those who suffer from conditions like body-focused repetitive behavior, the Keen device and HabitAware app go beyond the supplementary value of most applications. With these modifications, the HabitAware offering will rise above self-awareness and help their customers along the path to a more successful recovery. The features suggested pave a way for the application to expand into intelligent trend detection and more meaningful therapy technique suggestions.</p>
